# DSA Visualizer – Basic

This is a beginner-focused version of the open-source [Algorithm Visualizer](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer).  
I customized it to focus only on fundamental algorithms like **Sorting** and **Searching**, which I’ve studied and implemented during my learning.
